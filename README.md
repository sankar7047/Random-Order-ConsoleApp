# Random-Order-ConsoleApp
A small function in C# that will accept a positive integer parameter N and return a list of numbers from 0 to N in a RANDOM ORDER. If the function gets executed multiples times with the same N value I will expect to get the 0..N numbers in different order every time the functions is executed.

- Small console app for the C# excercise.
  - Takes a number and displays all the numbers from 0 to n in random order.
  - Each time the numbers will be displayed in random order.
